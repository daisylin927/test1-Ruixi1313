## Assignment: Greedy Algorithm (Individual)

This document is the **design plan**. Complete it **before writing your code** in `algorithm.py`.  


## 1. Problem & Algorithm
- What greedy problem are you solving?  
- What is the **input** and what is the **expected output**?  
- What is the goal of your greedy algorithm (e.g., maximize, minimize, optimize)?  

## 2. Greedy Strategy
- What is your **greedy choice** at each step?  
- Why do you believe this greedy choice works?  

git 
## 3. Test Cases
List at least **3 test cases** you will use, including edge cases.  
- Case 1: Normal input  
- Case 2: Edge case (e.g., empty or minimal input)  
- Case 3: Tricky or unusual input  


## 4. Revision Plan
- How will you improve your code after the first version?  
- How will test results guide your revisions?  


## 5. Expected Challenges
- What difficulties might you face in implementing the algorithm?  
- What mistakes do you think you might make at first?  


## 6. Timeline & Commits
You must make at least **3 commits over 2+ days**.  
- **Commit 1**: Completed DESIGN_PLAN.md  
- **Commit 2**: First version of algorithm in `algorithm.py`  
- **Commit 3**: Add tests in `tests/`, refine algorithm
